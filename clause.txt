Massachusetts has been the wheel within
Boston the wheel within
Boston is the capital and largest city of the state of
Massachusetts officially the
Boston also serves as county seat of the state s
It is the largest city in
The city is the anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area called
Boston home to million people and the tenth largest metropolitan area in the country 
One of the oldest cities in the
Boston was founded on the
Puritan colonists from
It was the scene of several key events of the
Revolution such as the
American independence from
Britain the city continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture

Boston is a great city and

Nowhere more than here have the principles of human freedom been expounded 
But for the circumstances already mentioned it would seem almost presumption for me to say anything here about those principles 
Boston the moral atmosphere is dark and heavy 
The principles of human liberty even
I correctly apprehended find but limited support in this hour a trial 
The world moves slowly and
Boston is much like the world 
We thought the principle of free speech was an accomplished fact 
Here if nowhere else we thought the right of the people to assemble and to express their opinion was secure 
Channing had defended the right 
Garrison had practically asserted the right and
Parker had maintained it with steadiness and fidelity to the last 
But here we are today contending for what we thought we gained years ago 
The mortifying and disgraceful fact stares us in the face that though
Monument stand freedom of speech is struck down 
No lengthy detail of facts is needed 
They are already notorious far more so than will be wished ten years hence 
Boston and among the friends of freedom we hear two voices one denouncing the mob that broke up our meeting on
Monday as a base and cowardly outrage and another deprecating and regretting the holding of such a meeting by such men at such a time 
We are told that the meeting was ill timed and the parties to it unwise 
To suppress free speech is a double wrong 
It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker 
It is just as criminal to rob a man of his right to speak and hear as it would be to rob him of his money 
Boston will vindicate this right 
But in order to do so there must be no concessions 
U ntil the right is accorded to the humblest as freely as to the most exalted citizen the government of
Boston is but an empty name and its freedom a mockery 
Our people are timid desponding recreant whimperers 
If they fail in their first enterprises they lose all heart 
If the young merchant fails men say he is ruined 
If the finest genius studies at the
College and is not ordained within a year afterwards in

They assure me that this place here and now is far more real than any other place or any other time 
Only in certain moments of great inner intensity do
I know this to be a lie 
X is a sense of reality the reality of other places and other times and it is the possession of it fragmentary and uncertain though it is that distinguishes man from all other animals

Far below and around lay the city like a ragged purple dream 
The irregular houses were like the broken exteriors of cliffs lining deep gulches and winding streams 
Some were mountainous some lay in long monotonous rows like the basalt precipices hanging over desert ca ons 
Such was the background of the wonderful cruel enchanting bewildering fatal great city 
But into this background were cut myriads of brilliant parallelograms and circles and squares through which glowed many colored lights 
And out of the violet and purple depths ascended like the city s soul sounds and odors and thrills that make up the civic body 
There arose the breath of gaiety unrestrained of love of hate of all the passions that man can know 
There below him lay all things good or bad that can be brought from the four corners of the earth to instruct please thrill enrich elevate cast down nurture or kill 
Thus the flavor of it came up to him and went into his blood

York people was all wise but no they can t get a chance to learn 
Every thing s too compressed 
Even the hayseeds are bailed hayseeds 
But what else can you expect from a town that s shut off from the world by the ocean on one side and

Not like the brazen giant of

For reasons becoming clear to me 
City you are dead to me 
Well you can turn back time but
I m never coming back 
Up in the heights of the evening skies
In sunset s golden and crimson dyes 
I look and a great joy clutches my throat
Plateau of roofs by canyons crossed windows by thousands fire furled
O gazing how the heart is lost in the

Gentiles most are wont 
To throng for trade and last quotations
Where hour by hour the rates of gold 
Outrival in the ears of people

The varied and ample land the

And ever the far spreading prairies covered with grass and corn
